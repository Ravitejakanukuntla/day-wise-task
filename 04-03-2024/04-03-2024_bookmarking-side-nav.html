    <h3><u>Chicken Biryani</u></h3>
    
    <pre>
  <u><b>Ingredients:</b></u>

  <u><p><b>For marinating the chicken:</b></p></u>
  - 1 kg chicken, cut into pieces
  - 1 cup yogurt
  - 2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste
  - 1 teaspoon red chili powder
  - 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
  - 1 teaspoon garam masala
  - Salt to taste
  - Juice of 1 lemon

  
  
<u><p><b>For the rice:</b></p></u>
- 2 cups basmati rice, soaked in water for 30 minutes and drained
- 4 cups water
- 2 bay leaves
- 4 green cardamom pods
- 4 cloves
- 1 cinnamon stick
- Salt to taste

<u><p><b>For cooking the biryani:</b></p></u>
- 4 tablespoons ghee or oil
- 2 large onions, thinly sliced
- 2 tomatoes, chopped
- 2 green chilies, slit
- 1/2 cup chopped mint leaves
- 1/2 cup chopped coriander leaves
- Saffron strands soaked in 1/4 cup warm milk
- Fried onions (optional)
- Cashews and raisins for garnish (optional)

<u><p><b>Instructions:</b></p></u>

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, salt, and lemon juice.
 Mix well to coat the chicken evenly with the marinade. Cover and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.

2. In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add soaked and drained basmati rice along with bay leaves, cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, and salt. Cook the 
rice until it's 70-80% done. Drain the excess water and set the rice aside.

3. In a separate large pot or deep skillet, heat ghee or oil over medium heat. Add thinly sliced onions and fry until they turn golden brown and crispy. Remove
 half of the fried onions and set aside for layering.

4. To the remaining onions in the pot, add chopped tomatoes and slit green chilies. Cook until the tomatoes are soft and oil starts to separate.

5. Add marinated chicken pieces to the pot along with chopped mint leaves and coriander leaves. Mix well and cook for about 10-15 minutes until the chicken is 
partially cooked and the gravy thickens.

6. In a separate small bowl, soak saffron strands in warm milk and set aside.

7. Once the chicken is partially cooked, layer the partially cooked rice evenly over the chicken in the pot.

8. Sprinkle the reserved fried onions, soaked saffron milk, cashews, and raisins (if using) on top of the rice layer.

9. Cover the pot tightly with a lid or aluminum foil to seal in the flavors. Cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes, allowing the biryani to steam and the flavors to
 meld together.

10. Once done, remove the pot from the heat and let it rest for 5-10 minutes before opening the lid.

11. Gently mix the biryani from the sides, fluffing up the rice and mixing it with the chicken and spices.

12. Serve the chicken biryani hot with raita (yogurt sauce), salad, or your favorite chutney.

Enjoy your delicious homemade chicken biryani!
